# Package Description and Purpose

- This package simulates NASA’s CADRE mission, which focuses on mapping the Moon through a trio of autonomous rovers. The simulation is developed using ROS 2 and is part of an open-sourced lunar exploration initiative slated for Spring 2026.

# The package consists of the following:


- **Lunar Landscape Design:**
  
1. Created a realistic lunar environment using Blender, based on publicly available lunar images from NASA’s gallery (https://science.nasa.gov/gallery/moon-images/).
2. Configured world parameters such as gravity, atmosphere, and pressure using data from NASA’s planetary factsheet for gazebo (https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/moonfact.html).

- **CAD Model Development:**
  
1. Constructed the CAD model of the CADRE rover from scratch using images and information from NASA JPL’s website (https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/cadre).
2. Implemented the model in SolidWorks and converted it to URDF format for use with ROS2 Humble.

- **Simulation and Integration:**
1. Integrated rover controls, IMU, LRF, and RGBD sensors for lunar mapping within the simulation.
2. Developed Python code to utilize point cloud data for mapping in relation to the Lander.

- **Teleoperation and Control:**
1. Created a Python GUI for teleoperation control of individual rovers, including camera visualization.
2. Set up ROS2 launch files to facilitate spawning multiple rovers as needed.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
1. Tested the simulation on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and VMware Linux, ensuring compatibility for developers who do not wish to dual boot or have access to a Linux environment.
   
- **Open-sourced :**
1. Open-sourced SolidWorks CAD files and Blender files.



# Future Work:

- Implementing reinforcement learning for coordinated mapping and exploration in Gazebo.

More Rovers can be added by using the following modification main.launch.xml:

'#' - numbers

Spawn coordinates[ x_,y_z_,roll_,pitch_yaw_]- location of the new rover

```xml
<include file="$(find-pkg-share robot_gazebo)/launch/spawn_with_control.launch.xml">
    <arg name="robot_name" value="robot_#"/>
    <arg name="robot_file" value="robot.xacro"/>
    <arg name="x_spawn" value="0.0"/>
    <arg name="y_spawn" value="0.0"/>
    <arg name="z_spawn" value="0.0"/>
    <arg name="roll_spawn" value="0.0"/>
    <arg name="pitch_spawn" value="0.0"/>
    <arg name="yaw_spawn" value="0.0"/>
</include>
```

# How to build and install

Follow these passages to build the docker image and start a docker container.

1. Clone this repository, change the directory to demos\CADRE_demo

2. Run the build script ```./build.sh```

3. Start the container by executing ```./run.sh```

4. (optional) Additional terminals can be opened by executing ```./open_cmd.sh```

5. **PLEASE MOVE THE MODELS [ Lunar and Luanr_lander ] to .gazebo/models in Home** (https://github.com/Sanjay-j-p/simulation/tree/main/models)
   

# CADRE simulation launch.

The CADRE demo can be started by executing the following commands:

Run ```ros2 launch robot_gazebo main.launch.xml```. This launch file will start the gazebo simulator with the Three CADRE rovers in the Lunar world.


# CADRE GUI teleopration.

In another terminal, run ```ros2 run robot_control joy.py```This will start GUI control for controlling individual Rovers.

# CADRE point clouds.

In another terminal, run ```ros2 run robot_control mapping.py```This will start the point cloud node and publish topics.
