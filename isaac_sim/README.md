# Space ROS Isaac Sim: Curiosity's Sulfur Stone Discovery in the Gediz Vallis Channel Demo

This repository provides a Docker image for our **NASA's Curiosity rover** demo based on **NVidia Isaac Sim** that interfaces with **Space ROS**. We also built a digital twin of the **Gediz Vallis Channel Environment**, focusing on the area surrounding the recent event of **sulfur stone discovery**. The map was developed using the **HIRISE Mars DTM** (real Mars terrain data) and with custom-made rock assets that seamlessly blend into the environment. It provides a highly detailed replication of the environment for both current and future missions. As of September 2024, Curiosity is still exploring within this region.

See [Map Documentation](./docs/maps.md)

## Building and Running the Container

Start the Docker with
```
sudo systemctl start docker
```

To build and launch the container you should cd to `docker` folder:

To build image use this script:
```bash
./build.sh
```

To run docker container use this script:
```bash
./run.sh
```
That's all you need to start the simulation environment.

### Cloning Repositories into Docker

The following repositories are cloned into the Docker container during the build process:

1. **[isaac_ros2_utils](https://github.com/AlexanderRex/isaac_ros2_utils)**
2. **[curiosity_rover_description](https://github.com/AlexanderRex/curiosity_rover_description)**
3. **[mars_rover_control](https://github.com/AlexanderRex/mars_rover_control)**

## Recommended Development Setup

For an optimized development workflow, it is recommended to use **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** along with its Docker-related extensions. These tools greatly simplify the process of interacting with Docker containers, especially when debugging and managing development environments.

### Recommended VSCode Extensions:
- **[Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)**: Enables you to develop inside a Docker container.
- **[Docker Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)**: Simplifies the management of Docker containers directly from VSCode.

By using these tools, you can streamline your workflow and improve the experience of working within a Dockerized development environment.

## Usage

IMPORTANT: Before launching scripts, execute this command to attach to **space_ros_isaac_sim** container or use **VSCode remote connection**.
```bash
sudo docker exec -it space_ros_isaac_sim /bin/bash
```

In the first terminal, enter the Docker container(if not already) and launch Isaac Sim with one of the following two environments

- For spawning Curiosity in the sulfur stone area in the **Gediz Vallis channel** environment
   ```
   python ~/curiosity_sim/scripts/gale_crater_scene.py 
   ```
- For spawning Curiosity in the **test ground** (under development) environment
   ```
   python ~/curiosity_sim/scripts/test_scene.py
   ```
Note: When launching Isaac Sim for the first time it can take several minutes because of shader compilation.


In the second terminal, enter the Docker container and launch the control system:
```bash
ros2 launch mars_rover_control mars_rover_control.launch.py
```

In the third terminal, for manual control using the keyboard:
```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```
Note: this terminal needs to be focused during keyboard control

### ROS Service Commands

In addition to ROS2 topics, the control graph supports various ROS2 service commands, allowing for precise control of different parts of the rover:

- **Drive the rover forward**:
    ```bash
    ros2 service call /move_forward std_srvs/srv/Empty
    ```

- **Stop the rover**:
    ```bash
    ros2 service call /move_stop std_srvs/srv/Empty
    ```

- **Turn left**:
    ```bash
    ros2 service call /turn_left std_srvs/srv/Empty
    ```

- **Turn right**:
    ```bash
    ros2 service call /turn_right std_srvs/srv/Empty
    ```

- **Open the tool arm**:
    ```bash
    ros2 service call /open_arm std_srvs/srv/Empty
    ```

- **Close the tool arm**:
    ```bash
    ros2 service call /close_arm std_srvs/srv/Empty
    ```

- **Open the mast (camera arm)**:
    ```bash
    ros2 service call /mast_open std_srvs/srv/Empty
    ```

- **Close the mast (camera arm)**:
    ```bash
    ros2 service call /mast_close std_srvs/srv/Empty
    ```

### Manuevering Curiosity on a Slope
There are many hills in the Gediz Vallis channel environment. Curiosity may drift downhill on a slope and it will require increased speed to counteract the incline.

### Recommended Render Settings for Isaac Sim

To optimize performance and maintain high FPS in the simulation, it is recommended to adjust the render settings in **Isaac Sim** as follows:

- **Enable DLSS**: Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a technology that uses AI to upscale images, which can significantly boost performance without compromising visual quality. Enabling DLSS is especially useful for maintaining high FPS in complex scenes.
  - For more information, refer to the [NVIDIA DLSS documentation](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/materials-and-rendering/latest/rtx-renderer_rt.html#dlss).

- **Adjust Viewport Resolution**: If your system struggles to maintain a stable FPS, reducing the resolution of the **Viewport** window can help. Lowering the viewport resolution reduces the computational load, improving performance during simulation.
  - You can find more details on adjusting the viewport resolution in the [Viewport Settings documentation](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_core/ext_viewport/controls/settings.html).

By using these settings, you can balance visual quality with performance, ensuring smoother operation of the simulation even on lower-end systems.
