# Vehicle Dust Plugin
The Dust Emission Plugin not only simulates dust clouds generated by heavy vehicles on planetary surfaces like Mars or the Moon, but it also impacts the performance of various sensors such as depth cameras, RGB cameras, and 3D LiDAR.

- Depth Cameras: Dust particles may scatter infrared light, leading to noise in depth data or complete failure to capture the scene accurately.

- RGB Cameras: Dust clouds can reduce visibility for RGB cameras, as they create a haze that obstructs clear imagery. This reduction in clarity can affect visual navigation, object detection, and color-based tracking.

- 3D LiDAR: Dust interferes with LiDAR systems by scattering laser beams, causing reflections that may distort the returned signal. This can result in inaccurate distance measurements and false readings of the environment, compromising obstacle detection and mapping.

By simulating dust and its interactions with sensors, the plugin provides a more challenging and realistic testing environment, helping to ensure that sensor-based systems function effectively in harsh planetary conditions.


## Usage

```xml
<plugin
    filename="VehicleDust"
    name="vehicle_dust::VehicleDust">
    <topic>/cmd_vel</topic>
    <emitter_model>buggy_model</emitter_model>
</plugin>   

```
- In order to load the pugin, add the above plugin tag into the world sdf and configure the following tags:
    - topic: The command interface topic used to drive the robot
    - emitter_model: Name of the robot in the simultion
