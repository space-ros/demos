# Drone Dust Plugin

The Drone Dust plugin not only simulates the dust clouds generated by a droneâ€™s thrusters during takeoff and landing, but also replicates how these dust particles affect onboard sensors crucial for autonomous operations.

- Depth Cameras: The dust clouds can scatter infrared or laser signals, causing depth cameras to misinterpret distances or fail to detect objects entirely, which can compromise altitude control and obstacle avoidance.

- RGB Cameras: Dust particles obscure visibility, reducing image clarity and potentially hindering visual navigation, object detection, and scene recognition used for autonomous decisions.

- 3D LiDAR: Dust clouds interfere with LiDAR by scattering its laser pulses, resulting in inaccurate 3D mapping and unreliable data on nearby objects or terrain, impacting the drone's ability to navigate and avoid obstacles autonomously.

By simulating these dust interactions, the plugin provides a realistic testing environment for drones, ensuring that autonomous systems can adapt to harsh planetary conditions where dust is a significant factor.

## Usage 

```xml
<plugin
    filename="DroneDust"
    name="drone_dust::DroneDust">
    <activation_distance>5</activation_distance>
    <min_distance>0.27</min_distance>
    <density_constant>12.0</density_constant>
    <model_name>ground_plane</model_name>
    <robot_name>ingenuity</robot_name>
</plugin>
```

- In order to load the pugin, add the above plugin tag into the world sdf and configure the following tags:
    - robot_name: Name of the robot in the simulation
    - model_name: Name of the base model in the simulation (Dusty Model)
    - density_const: Multiplier for the amount of dust to be produced
    - min_distance: Minimum difference in height at which dust starts to produce
    - activation_distance: Maximum difference in height at which dust stops to produce
