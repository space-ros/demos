# FREISA Robot Dog with Space ROS Mars Rover Demo

## Introduction

This demo integrates the simulation of the [FREISA Robot Dog](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/FREISA) (based on the [Mini Pupper 2 Pro](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mdrobotkits/md-robot-kits-open-source-support-your-genai-creativity) by [MangDang (HK) Limited](https://mangdang.store/)) inside the [Space ROS Mars Rover demo](https://space-ros.github.io/docs/rolling/Demos.html).

This code is a part of the following challenge:

* Challenge Name: NASA Space ROS Sim Summer Sprint Challenge
* Team Lead Freelancer Username: [@gmacario](https://www.freelancer.com/u/gmacario)
* Submission Title: Integrate FREISA Robot Dog with Space ROS Mars Rover Demo

## Added bonus

The proposed feature is only dealing with the integration of the [Mini Pupper 2](https://github.com/mangdangroboticsclub) robot inside Space ROS demo.
However, once the PR is merged, as an added bonus it should be possible to instantiate in the Space ROS Demo any of the quadruped robots supported by [CHAMP](https://github.com/chvmp/champ):

## Authors

The FREISA Robot Dog with Space ROS Mars Rover Demo is another fine project by [the B-AROL-O Team](https://github.com/B-AROL-O) - a group of friends who in their spare time enjoy creating fun projects with Robotics, Computer Vision and [LEGOÂ®](https://www.lego.com/).

Everything we do - both hardware and software - is Open Source and [shared on GitHub](https://github.com/B-AROL-O).

Our projects have been awarded several prizes in worldwide competitions on Computer Vision and robotics.
As an example, project "[Four-legged Robot Ensuring Intelligent Sprinkler Automation](https://www.hackster.io/projects/845012)" (a.k.a. [FREISA](https://github.com/B-AROL-O/FREISA)) - was the Grand Prize Winner ðŸ¥‡ of the [OpenCV AI Competition 2023](https://www.hackster.io/contests/opencv-ai-competition-2023) with [OpenCV](https://www.hackster.io/opencv), [Khadas](https://www.hackster.io/khadas) and [Seeed Studio](https://www.hackster.io/seeed).
